Explicitly casting `input_values_for_encode` to `torch.float16` before passing it to the encoder will ensure the correct data type for mixed-precision training, as the `autocast` context handles the operations but the initial tensor might still be `float32`.

        "The training process is failing because the `preprocess_function` is returning empty data due to an issue with the `model.audio_encoder.encode` call, which is specifically related to the data type handling within the `autocast` context. Explicitly casting `input_values_for_encode` to `torch.float16` before passing it to the encoder will ensure the correct data type for mixed-precision training, as the `autocast` context handles the operations but the initial tensor might still be `float32`. Additionally, removing the print statement for `audio_codes` in the exception block prevents an `UnboundLocalError` if `audio_codes` is not assigned before an error occurs during the encoding process.\n",

Explicitly casting `input_values_for_encode` to `torch.float16` before passing it to the encoder will ensure the correct data type for mixed-precision training, as the `autocast` context handles the operations but the initial tensor might still be `float32`. Additionally, removing the print statement for `audio_codes` in the exception block prevents an `UnboundLocalError` if `audio_codes` is not assigned before an error occurs during the encoding process.\n",

Explicitly casting `input_values_for_encode` to `torch.float16` before passing it to the encoder will ensure the correct data type for mixed-precision training, as the `autocast` context handles the operations but the initial tensor might still be `float32`. Additionally, removing the print statement for `audio_codes` in the exception block prevents an `UnboundLocalError` if `audio_codes` is not assigned before an error occurs during the encoding process.\n",

        "The current `preprocess_function` has a type mismatch when passing `input_values_for_encode` to the audio encoder within the `autocast` context, and a potential `UnboundLocalError` in the exception handling. Explicitly casting `input_values_for_encode` to `torch.float16` before passing it to the encoder will ensure correct data type for mixed-precision training. Removing the print statement for `audio_codes` in the `except` block will prevent `UnboundLocalError` if `audio_codes` is not assigned before an error occurs.\n",

This is likely due to an incorrect data type passed to the encoder within the `autocast` context. I will modify `preprocess_function` to ensure `input_values_for_encode` remains `float32` before entering the `autocast` block, allowing `autocast` to manage the mixed-precision conversion for the encoder correctly.

This is likely due to an incorrect data type passed to the encoder within the `autocast` context. I will modify `preprocess_function` to ensure `input_values_for_encode` remains `float32` before entering the `autocast` block, allowing `autocast` to manage the mixed-precision conversion for the encoder correctly. I will also remove the problematic print statement from the exception block to prevent `UnboundLocalError` if `audio_codes` is not assigned.\n",

The core issue remains that `input_values_for_encode` is being explicitly cast to `torch.float16` before entering the `autocast` block, whereas `autocast` is designed to handle this conversion internally when the input is `float32`. I will remove this explicit `float16` cast to allow `autocast` to function as intended and prevent the `model.audio_encoder.encode` from returning a non-tensor type, which led to the empty dataset error.\n",

The core issue remains that `input_values_for_encode` is being explicitly cast to `torch.float16` before entering the `autocast` block, whereas `autocast` is designed to handle this conversion internally when the input is `float32`. I will remove this explicit `float16` cast to allow `autocast` to function as intended and prevent the `model.audio_encoder.encode` from returning a non-tensor type, which led to the empty dataset error.\n",

        "The previous attempts to fix the `preprocess_function` did not fully resolve the error. The core issue remains that `input_values_for_encode` is being explicitly cast to `torch.float16` before entering the `autocast` block, whereas `autocast` is designed to handle this conversion internally when the input is `float32`. I will remove this explicit `float16` cast to allow `autocast` to function as intended and prevent the `model.audio_encoder.encode` from returning a non-tensor type, which led to the empty dataset error. Additionally, the problematic print statement in the exception block will be removed to prevent `UnboundLocalError` if `audio_codes` is not assigned.\n",

        "The previous attempts to fix the `preprocess_function` did not resolve the core issue. The `model.audio_encoder.encode` method was unexpectedly returning a string instead of a tensor, leading to an empty dataset and the `ValueError: num_samples=0`. This is likely due to an incorrect shape for the `padding_mask_for_encode` tensor. The `audio_encoder.encode` expects a 2D padding mask (`(batch_size, sequence_length)`), but the fallback in the current `preprocess_function` was creating a 3D mask (`(batch_size, 1, sequence_length)`). I will modify the fallback logic to correctly create a 2D attention mask.\n",

This is likely caused by the `padding_mask_for_encode` having an incorrect 3D shape `(batch_size, 1, sequence_length)` when the `audio_encoder.encode` expects a 2D shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`. I will modify the fallback logic for creating the `attention_mask` to ensure it is always 2D.\n",

This is likely caused by the `padding_mask_for_encode` having an incorrect 3D shape `(batch_size, 1, sequence_length)` when the `audio_encoder.encode` expects a 2D shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`. I will modify the fallback logic for creating the `attention_mask` to ensure it is always 2D.\n",

This is likely caused by the `padding_mask_for_encode` having an incorrect 3D shape `(batch_size, 1, sequence_length)` when the `audio_encoder.encode` expects a 2D shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`. I will modify the fallback logic for creating the `attention_mask` to ensure it is always 2D, and ensure `input_values_for_encode` is not explicitly cast to `float16` before `autocast`.\n",

        "The previous attempt to fix the `preprocess_function` did not fully resolve the error. The core issue remains that `input_values_for_encode` is being explicitly cast to `torch.float16` before entering the `autocast` block, whereas `autocast` is designed to handle this conversion internally when the input is `float32`. I will remove this explicit `float16` cast to allow `autocast` to function as intended and prevent the `model.audio_encoder.encode` from returning a non-tensor type, which led to the empty dataset error. Additionally, the problematic print statement in the exception block will be removed to prevent `UnboundLocalError` if `audio_codes` is not assigned.\n",

        "The previous attempts to fix the `preprocess_function` did not fully resolve the error. The core issue remains that `input_values_for_encode` is being explicitly cast to `torch.float16` before entering the `autocast` block, whereas `autocast` is designed to handle this conversion internally when the input is `float32`. I will remove this explicit `float16` cast to allow `autocast` to function as intended and prevent the `model.audio_encoder.encode` from returning a non-tensor type, which led to the empty dataset error. Additionally, the problematic print statement in the exception block will be removed to prevent `UnboundLocalError` if `audio_codes` is not assigned.\n",

        "The previous attempts to fix the `preprocess_function` did not fully resolve the error. The core issue remains that `input_values_for_encode` is being explicitly cast to `torch.float16` before entering the `autocast` block, whereas `autocast` is designed to handle this conversion internally for `float32` inputs. I will remove this explicit `float16` cast to allow `autocast` to function as intended. Additionally, the fallback logic for creating the `attention_mask` will be updated to ensure it is always 2D, as the `audio_encoder.encode` expects this shape. The problematic print statement from the exception block will also be removed to prevent `UnboundLocalError` if `audio_codes` is not assigned.\n",

        "*   **Persistent Training Failure:** The training loop consistently failed with a `ValueError: num_samples=0`, indicating that the dataset being fed to the trainer was empty.\n",
        "*   **Root Cause in Preprocessing:** The primary issue was traced back to the `preprocess_function`, where `model.audio_encoder.encode` was unexpectedly returning a string instead of a PyTorch tensor for `audio_codes`. This led to the `preprocess_function` returning empty dictionaries for problematic batches.\n",
        "*   **Identified Issues within `preprocess_function`:**\n",
        "    *   **Incorrect Data Type Handling:** An explicit `torch.float16` cast on `input_values_for_encode` before using `torch.amp.autocast` was interfering with the mixed-precision conversion.\n",
        "    *   **Attention Mask Dimensionality:** The `padding_mask_for_encode` (attention mask) was not consistently a 2D tensor of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, which is required by the audio encoder. Fallback mechanisms for creating this mask were incorrect.\n",
        "    *   **Error Logging Issue:** An `UnboundLocalError` could occur within exception handling due to attempting to print `audio_codes` when it might not have been assigned.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "*   **Robust Data Pipeline Essential:** The issues highlight the critical importance of robust data preprocessing and validation, especially when dealing with complex model architectures and mixed-precision training. Thorough checking of tensor shapes and types at each step can prevent silent failures.\n",
        "*   **Further Debugging `model.audio_encoder.encode`:** Although fixes were applied to the `preprocess_function` to ensure correct inputs, the fact that `model.audio_encoder.encode` returned a string suggests a deeper issue within the encoder itself when it encounters inputs it cannot process into valid audio codes. Further investigation into the internal workings or error handling of the `model.audio_encoder.encode` method could provide more resilience.\n"
