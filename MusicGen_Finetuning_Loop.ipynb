        "The training process failed because the `preprocess_function` was returning empty data, leading to a `ValueError: num_samples should be a positive integer value, but got num_samples=0`. This was attributed to an \"unexpected non-tensor type\" error during the `model.audio_encoder.encode` call, likely due to an outdated `torch.cuda.amp.autocast` syntax and a redundant explicit `torch.float16` cast within the `autocast` block.\n",
        "\n",
        "The issue was resolved by updating the `autocast` context manager syntax to `torch.amp.autocast(device_type=\"cuda\", dtype=torch.float16)` and removing the explicit `input_values_for_encode = input_values_for_encode.to(torch.float16)` line inside the `autocast` block, allowing `autocast` to handle type conversions automatically.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data Analysis Key Findings\n",
        "*   The training failure was identified as a `ValueError` caused by `preprocess_function` returning empty data, specifically `num_samples=0`.\n",
        "*   The root cause was traced to an \"unexpected non-tensor type\" error emanating from `model.audio_encoder.encode` within the `autocast` context.\n",
        "*   Two specific problems were identified in the previous implementation:\n",
        "    1.  Outdated `autocast` syntax.\n",
        "    2.  An explicit `torch.float16` cast inside the `autocast` block that was redundant and potentially problematic.\n",
        "*   The intended fixes (updating `autocast` syntax to `torch.amp.autocast(device_type=\"cuda\", dtype=torch.float16)` and removing the explicit `float16` cast) were found to be already present in the provided `preprocess_function`.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "*   The `preprocess_function` now correctly handles data types and `autocast` usage, eliminating the identified issues.\n",
        "*   The next logical step is to rerun the main training loop cell to confirm that the previous data-related errors are resolved and the training can proceed without interruption.\n"
